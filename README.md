## Florian Scholz 

Hi :wave: I'm Florian (he/his) – a senior technical writer and documentation engineer. I'm currently looking for a new opportunity. For the last 10 years, I worked [@mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla) on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) as lead content strategist, technical writer & documentation engineer. I live in Bremen, Germany. I'm an experienced remote worker, but also open to relocation.

### Projects I'm proud of

- [MDN browser compat data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data) – project and technical lead for compatibility data that powers the compat tables on MDN and [caniuse](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/09/caniuse-and-mdn-compat-data-collaboration/).
- [MDN JavaScript docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) – I completely rewrote the ECMAScript docs in light of ES6 in 2015 and maintained them since then according to the latest TC39 specifications.
- [MDN HTTP docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) – co-authored the original MDN HTTP docs in 2016 and curated them since then.

:sparkles: Technical Writing is as much about being an investigator as it is about being an educator. :sparkles:
