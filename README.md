## Florian Scholz 

Hi :wave: I'm Florian (he/him) - the Content Lead of [Open Web Docs](https://github.com/openwebdocs). I'm into documenting the open web and making knowledge available to web developers & designers worldwide. You can learn more about OWD and support me and team on our [open collective page](https://opencollective.com/open-web-docs).

In late 2009, I got involved with [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) and from 2013 until August 2020 I worked at [@mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla) as MDN's lead content strategist, technical writer & documentation engineer.

My favourite conference is [Write The Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org). Say hi if you're there, too. :blush:

I live in Bremen, Germany, and I enjoy listening to wave music and collecting records.

### Projects I'm proud of

- [MDN browser compat data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data) – project and technical lead for compatibility data that powers the compat tables on MDN and [caniuse](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/09/caniuse-and-mdn-compat-data-collaboration/).
- [MDN JavaScript docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) – I completely rewrote the ECMAScript docs in light of ES6 in 2015 and maintained them since then according to the latest TC39 specifications.
- [MDN HTTP docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) – co-authored the original MDN HTTP docs in 2016 and curated them since then.

:sparkles: Technical Writing is as much about being an investigator as it is about being an educator. :sparkles:
