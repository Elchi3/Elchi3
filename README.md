## Florian Scholz 

Hi :wave: I'm Florian (he/him), Director of [Open Web Docs](https://openwebdocs.org). 

Open Web Docs (OWD) documents the open web and makes knowledge available to web developers & designers worldwide. You can learn more about OWD and sponsor the team and me on our [open collective page](https://opencollective.com/open-web-docs).

In late 2009, I got involved with [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) as a volunteer and from 2013 until August 2020 I worked at Mozilla as MDN's Lead Content Strategist, Technical Writer & Documentation Engineer. In January 2021, I [co-founded](https://opencollective.com/open-web-docs/updates/introducing-open-web-docs) Open Web Docs. 

My favourite conference is [Write The Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org). Please say hi if you're attending, too! :blush:

I live in Bremen, Germany. When not reviewing pull requests or writing content, I enjoy listening to wave and post-punk music.

:sparkles: Technical Writing is as much about being an investigator as it is about being an educator. :sparkles:
